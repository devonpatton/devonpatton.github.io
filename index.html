 <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
 <p> I graduated from Winona State university in 2017 with a Bachelors of Arts degree in Psychology. After carefully considering my
  options, I decided that the field of computer science seemed more promising. I am excited to start learning to code and create cool
  stuff like this website!</p>
 <h2>Work Experience</h2>
  <h3>Care Coordinator at The Mentor Network, Rochester, MN, Summer 2016<h3>
   <p> I looked after and supported children and teens with mental health problems such as Autism, ADHD, and Anxiety.
    I accompanied them on trips to the zoo, to movies, parks, and swimming areas. I tried to be a good role model for them and to 
    help them feel comfortable out in the community. </p>
